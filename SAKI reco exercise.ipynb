    "Here are some things you would do in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- more properly separate between training and test data.\n",
    "- make the code more modular so you can evaluate arbitrary algorithms.\n",
    "- Look into other methods, e.g. content based filtering. You could for example take the genre data, and suggest the most popular movie from a given genre.\n",
    "- You could look into factorization methods like Alternate Least Squares or versions of non-negative matrix factorization. These are dimension-reduction methods that try to explain the ratings in terms of a smaller number of factors. These \"compress\" data and could help if the data is very sparse.\n",
    "- Productionize the system. It is not uncommon for recommendation systems to compute all recommendations in a batch fashion and then just load the recommended items into a database. No need to run a ML model in production.\n",
